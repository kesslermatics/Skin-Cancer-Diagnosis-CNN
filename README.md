# Skin-Cancer-Diagnosis-CNN
This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify skin lesions based on the HAM10000 dataset, which contains over 10,000 dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions. The goal is to build a deep learning model that helps identify skin cancer types to support early diagnosis and dermatological decision-making.
